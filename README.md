Simple Javascript 

The task was given to determine the maximum words count in an array, so I used the simple split function to count words, making a loop to
determine every words in every index, and using if-else function to compare maximum value per iteration so that the most word counted
will be known as an answer

Please be kind to look at my other repository, I have already create repository to ceck and predict the weather by using an API with fetch 
async-await function. Then I also learned ReactJS in the last repository to create simple To-Do list.

Thank you :)
